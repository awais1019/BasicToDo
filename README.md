# To Do App

## Description
This is a basic to-do app designed to demonstrate the implementation of the Room database and MVVM architecture in Android development. The app focuses on creating and managing tasks with a simple interface. Due to the straightforward nature of the tasks, advanced functionalities like updating tasks are not specifically implemented.

## Features
- **Task Management:** Create and delete tasks.
- **Local Storage:** Tasks are stored locally using the Room database.
- **User Interface:** Simple and user-friendly design.

## Technologies Used
- **Kotlin:** The primary programming language for Android development.
- **XML:** Utilized for designing UI layouts.
- **Room:** Provides local database storage for tasks.
- **MVVM:** Architecture pattern used to structure the application.
- **Android Studio:** Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Android development.
